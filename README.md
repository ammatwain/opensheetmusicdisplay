## Introduction

This project is a practical implementation of another
project of mine, ETC (Equal Temperament Calculator),
available at the link:
[https://github.com/ammatwain/ETC/](https://github.com/ammatwain/ETC/)

The transposition calculator is called ExtendedTransposeCalculator and uses ETC's routines to calculate transpositions.

## What ExtendedTransposeCalculator Offers to OpenSheetMusicDisplay

With ExtendedTransposeCalculator, you can:
1. Transpose to and from any key, with the optional addition of ascending or descending octaves.
2. Transpose by semitones, adjusting the key signature to the requested semitone.
3. Transpose by musical intervals.
4. Transpose diatonically.
